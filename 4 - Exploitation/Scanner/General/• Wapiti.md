<h2>What is Wapiti</h2>

Wapiti works as a "black-box" vulnerability scanner, that means it won't study the source code of web applications but will work like a fuzzer, scanning the pages of the deployed web application, extracting links and forms and attacking the scripts, sending payloads and looking for error messages, special strings or abnormal behaviors.

Commands
```
wapiti -u DOMAIN

wapiti -h
```
