# Hacking-Notes-Red-Team

--- ---

Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains notes and resources related to ethical hacking, also known as "red teaming." Here, you'll find a wealth of information on various aspects of hacking, including information gathering, scanning and enumeration, web hacking, exploitation, and windows/linux hacking.

Starting with information gathering, you'll find techniques and tools for gathering information about a target system or network, such as reconnaissance and footprinting. This information can then be used to identify potential vulnerabilities and plan your attack.

Moving on to scanning and enumeration, you'll learn about the various methods used to map out a target network, including port scanning and network mapping. These techniques allow you to identify open ports, running services, and other information that can help you identify potential vulnerabilities.

In the section on web hacking, you'll find information on various types of injection vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS). You'll learn about the mechanics of these attacks, as well as how to detect and prevent them.

The exploitation section of the repository covers techniques for taking advantage of vulnerabilities in order to gain unauthorized access to a target system. This may involve techniques such as buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or other methods of compromising a system.

Finally, you'll find information on windows and linux hacking, including techniques for exploiting vulnerabilities in these popular operating systems. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced hacker, you'll find valuable information and resources in this repository to help you improve your skills and better understand the world of ethical hacking.
