<h2>What is DNSdumper</h2>

DNSDumpster will return the collected DNS information in easy-to-read tables and a graph. DNSDumpster will also provide any collected information about listening servers.

DNSDumpster will also represent the collected information graphically. DNSDumpster displayed the data from the table earlier as a graph. You can see the DNS and MX branching to their respective servers and also showing the IP addresses.

There is currently a beta feature that allows you to export the graph as well. You can manipulate the graph and move blocks around if needed.
