<h3>General</h3>

The Hash-Identifier tool is used to identify the type of hash used to encrypt a password or other data. It takes a hash value as input and then performs a series of tests to determine the algorithm used to create the hash. Once the algorithm is identified, the tool can help to determine the original plaintext value that was hashed.
