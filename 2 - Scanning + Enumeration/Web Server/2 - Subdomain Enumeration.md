Subdomain enumeration is the process of identifying all subdomains of a given domain. This can be done using various tools, such as recon-ng, dnsrecon, and Sublist3r. Some common methods used in subdomain enumeration include using search engines, brute-force techniques, and scraping website pages. The goal of subdomain enumeration is to identify subdomains that may contain vulnerabilities or sensitive information that can be used in further attacks.
