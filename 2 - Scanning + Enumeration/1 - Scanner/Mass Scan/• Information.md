<h2>What is Mass Scan</h2>

MASSCAN is TCP port scanner which transmits SYN packets asynchronously and produces results similar to nmap, the most famous port scanner. Internally, it operates more like scanrand, unicornscan, and ZMap, using asynchronous transmission. Itâ€™s a flexible utility that allows arbitrary address and port ranges.
