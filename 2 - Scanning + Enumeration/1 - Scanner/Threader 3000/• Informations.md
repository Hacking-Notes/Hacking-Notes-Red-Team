<h2>What's Threader3000</h2>

Threader3000 is a script written in Python3 that allows multi-threaded port scanning. The program is interactive and simply requires you to run it to begin. Once started, you will be asked to input an IP address or a FQDN as Threader3000 does resolve hostnames. A full port scan can take as little as 15 seconds, but at max should take less than 1 minute 30 seconds depending on your internet connection.

Features
- Faster then Nmap
- Run target and specific Nmap scan after discovering some ports
